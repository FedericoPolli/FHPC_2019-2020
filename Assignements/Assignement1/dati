	1982 Cray X-MP 800 MFLOPS
	1985 Cray-2 1.9 GFLOPS

Section 1
	Modify scalability by sending partial sums to other processor, so to use more the other processors.


Section 2
Pi.c time on N=10000000 is 0.5 sec
Mpi.C time on N=10000000 with 1 processor is 0.85 sec  --> parallel overhead caused by MPI is approx 0.35 sec
Mpi.C time on N=10000000 with 2 processors is 0.65 sec


Consider the maximum of time of processors (should be the master)

Parallel overhead: lowest time-largest time more or less
